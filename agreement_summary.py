agreement_summary.py - roll address-level results up to the agreement level.

Business rule (from the manager, this is the whole point of this module):
one Agreement No can appear multiple times with a DIFFERENT address on each
row (e.g. AG001 x5, five different addresses on file for it). The agreement
is only as good as its worst address - if even ONE of an agreement's
addresses is Critical, the entire agreement gets flagged Critical for
follow-up, even if the other 4 are perfectly clean. Same idea one level
down for Warning.

Severity rollup precedence (worst wins): Critical > Warning > Clean.
"Clean (reviewer-cleared)" counts as Clean here - a human already reviewed
and cleared that specific address.
