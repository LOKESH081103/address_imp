Robustness & scale notes
-------------------------
Real-world networks (corporate proxies, VPNs, patchy wifi) are unreliable
in ways that show up as "some rows couldn't be verified" if the client is
naive - and calling the API once per ROW is a non-starter for large files:
India has ~19,000 unique pincodes total, so a 1-lakh-row file has at most
~19,000 distinct pincodes to actually look up no matter how many rows
share them. This module is built around that:
  - `lookup_pincodes_bulk()` dedupes the pincodes first, then fetches the
    unique ones concurrently with a thread pool (network I/O, not CPU-bound,
    so threads are the right tool). This turns "100,000 sequential round
    trips" into "~19,000 deduped lookups split across N workers".
  - A single `requests.Session` is reused so TLS/TCP connections are kept
    alive instead of renegotiating per pincode.
  - Each request gets 2 automatic retries (3 attempts total) with backoff
    for connection hiccups and 5xx responses.
  - A thread-safe circuit breaker: after a few consecutive network-level
    failures (not 404s - those are legitimate "pincode doesn't exist"
    answers), it's almost always a local connectivity problem, not this
    specific pincode. Rather than making the batch wait out a timeout on
    every remaining pincode, the client "opens" and fails fast for a short
    cooldown, then quietly tries again.
  - `check_connectivity()` gives a one-shot, specific diagnosis (DNS/
    firewall/timeout/etc.) the UI can surface on demand instead of a vague
    "no internet or API down".
  - A stall watchdog on the bulk path: `timeout=` on a `requests` call does
    NOT reliably bound DNS resolution on every platform/proxy setup, so a
    handful of pincodes can occasionally hang past their nominal timeout.
    Waiting on ALL futures (the naive `as_completed()` usage) means even
    one such straggler blocks the entire batch forever - and even worse,
    exiting a `with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:` block calls
    `shutdown(wait=True)`, which blocks again on the same stuck threads.
    `lookup_pincodes_bulk()` instead polls with a bounded per-round timeout;
    if a full round passes with zero new completions, everything still
    pending is marked "ERROR" and the executor is shut down with
    `wait=False` - the stuck thread(s) are abandoned in the background
    rather than allowed to freeze the whole run.
